Hi there! I'm Paul. I’m a physics major turned programmer.  
Ever since I first

learned how to program while taking a scientific computing for physics course, I have pursued programming as a passion, and as a career. Check out [my personal website](https://www.lenpaul.com/) for more information on my other projects (including more Jekyll themes!), as well as some of my writing.
